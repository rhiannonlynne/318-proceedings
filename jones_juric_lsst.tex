The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will be a ground-based,
optical, all-sky, rapid cadence survey project with tremendous
potential for discovering and characterizing asteroids.

With LSST's large 6.5m diameter primary mirror, a wide 9.6 square
degree field of view 3.2 Gigapixel camera, and rapid observational
cadence, LSST will discover more than 5 million asteroids over its ten
year survey lifetime. With a single visit limiting magnitude of 24.5
in $r$ band, LSST will be able to detect asteroids in the Main Belt
down to sub-kilometer sizes.  The current strawman for the LSST survey
strategy is to obtain two visits (each `visit' being a pair of
back-to-back 15s exposures) per field, separated by about 30 minutes,
covering the entire visible sky every 3-4 days throughout the
observing season, for ten years.

The catalogs generated by LSST will increase the known number of small
bodies in the Solar System by a factor of 10-100 times, among all
populations. The median number of observations for Main Belt asteroids
will be on the order of 200-300, with Near Earth Objects receiving a
median of 90 observations. These observations will be spread among
$ugrizy$ bandpasses, providing photometric colors and the allowing
sparse lightcurve inversion to determine rotation periods, spin axes, and shape information.

These catalogs will be created using automated detection software, the
LSST Moving Object Processing System (MOPS), that will take advantage
of the carefully characterized LSST optical system, cosmetically
clean camera, and recent improvements in difference imaging. Tests
with the prototype MOPS software indicate that linking detections (and thus
`discovery') will be possible at LSST depths with our working
model for the survey strategy, but evaluation of MOPS and improvements
in the survey strategy will continue. All data productsand software created by
LSST will be publicly available.

\section{Introduction}

The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is a next-generation survey
project, coupling a world-class telescope facility with cutting-edge
data management software and calibration efforts. Its primary science
drivers are to constrain dark matter and dark energy, to map the Milky
Way and Local Volume, to catalog the Solar System, and to explore
the transient optical sky. The catalogs generated by LSST during its
ten years of operation will enable a multitude of science
investigations beyond these primary science drivers, many of which are
explored in the LSST Science Book (ref).

The inventory of the Solar System is one of the primary science
drivers for LSST; fulfilling this science goal will include
discovering millions of minor planets, increasing the number of known
objects in every small body population by a factor of 10 to 100 above
current levels. Almost all of these objects will receive large numbers
($>100$) of observations, over a long time span (several years) and with
extremely accurate astrometry (10mas errors), resulting in highly
accurate orbits suitable for a wide range of theoretical studies or
for targeted follow up observations for specific purposes (such as
spectroscopy or occultation studies).

These large number of observations will also provide the basis for
sparse lightcurve inversion, which requires at least 100 observations
over a range of phase angles (ref). It will be possible to determine
the spin states and shapes for thousands of Main belt
asteroids. Frequent observations, spread among a wide range of times
and at variety of different points along each object's orbit, are also
ideal for detecting activity, either collisionally-induced activity or
surface activity induced by volatile outgassing (ref).

Each object will obtain observations in different filters, primarily $g$,
$r$, $i$ and $z$ but also $u$ and $y$, with photometric calibration of
each measurement accurate to 10mmags (lsst photoref). This will enable study of the
composition of these objects (ref). Adding color information also
provides statistical constraints on the albedos of the objects,
allowing a tighter estimate of the diameters and thus size
distribution of the population. With combined color and orbital
information, identification of collisional families becomes more
robust. Table \ref{table1} provides a summary of the expected number
of objects in each population, as well as their typical arc length and
number of observations.

Construction for LSST is ongoing, with first light scheduled for 2020,
a scientific commissioning program following in the next year, and the
start of survey operations in 2022. Details of LSST operations are
currently being examined. In particular, the survey strategy continue
to be analyzed up to and during operations in order to maximize the
science return across the wide variety of goals for LSST. In this
proceedings, we will describe the planned LSST configuration, and
expected LSST performance in discovering and characterizing Near Earth
Objects (NEOs) and Main Belt asteroids (MBAs), then present software
tools that can aid the planetary astronomy community in extending
this analysis.

\section{The LSST telescope}

The primary science goals for LSST drive the design of the telescope
and camera, coupling the size of the telescope, area in the field of
view, filter choices and typical exposure time to achieve the desired
single image depth, coadded image depth, number of repeat visits and
their distribution among filters, and survey footprint.

The resulting final design is an optical telescope with
$ugrizy$ filters and a primary mirror of 8.4m in
diameter (the effective diameter is 6.7m after account for obscuration
and vignetting). The telescope has a fast f/1.2 focal ratio; together
with the 3.2 Gigapixel camera, this provides a 9.6 square degree field
of view with 0.2 ''/pixel platescale. Short exposures and a rapid
survey strategy covering the entire visible sky every three to four
nights in multiple filters complete the basic strategy to meet these
science goals.

The details of the observing strategy will be discussed further in
Section~\ref{surveystrategy}, but at the base of the cadence is the
pair of back-to-back 15 second exposures that make up a 30 second
`visit'. For most purposes, this 30 second visit can be considered the
equivalent exposure time for LSST; the back-to-back `snaps' will be
processed separately to help reject cosmic rays (and could be used to
help determine velocity direction for trailing moving objects), but
the images will be combined for most purposes and individual `image'
depths correspond to the 30 second `visit' $5\sigma$ point-source
limiting magnitude. This drives further design choices for the
telescope; in order to maintain a high duty cycle, the camera readout time
is only 2 seconds per exposure and the slew-settle time between
nearby fields is only 5 seconds per visit.

The fill factor of the camera is 90\%, counting active silicon within
a $3.5^\circ$ diameter circle inscribed in the field of view; the fill
factor counting only chip gaps but over the entire (non-circular)
focal plane is slightly higher, but similar. See
Figure~\ref{focalplane} for an illustration of the focal plane.

The information above can be combined with weather information from
the Cerro Pachon site (such as the expected atmospheric IQ and sky
brightness) and system engineering data on the expected throughput
response curves in order to calculate the fiducial five sigma limiting
depths for LSST. An on-site monitoring system at Cerro Pachon has been
used to record free atmospheric FWHM values over several years; the
median values are reported in Table~\ref{table2}, adjusted for each
bandpass. The telescope hardware is expected to contribute an
additional 0.4 arcseconds. The expected dark sky skybrightness can
also be generated using detailed sky spectra obtained elsewhere (Patat
refs) modified to match broad-band sky brightness measurements
reported from Cerro Pachon and other nearby sites.

System engineering continually updates the expected throughput curves,
based on updated data from prototype sensors and the expected
performance of the mirrors and filters and lenses, including broadband
coatings and loss estimates due to condensation and contamination. The
current performance estimates are available in a github repository, at
\url{http://github.com/lsst-pst/syseng_throughputs}.  Using these
throughput curves and the information above, we can calculate the
expected five-sigma point-source limiting magnitudes for LSST, under
fiducial seeing and dark sky conditions, as shown in
Table~\ref{table2}. The throughput curves for each filter are
illustrated in Figure~\ref{throughputs}.

\section{LSST data management}

LSST will acquire millions of images (on the order of 2.5 million
visits, each consisting of a pair of exposures). The LSST Data
Management (DM) software pipeline has the task of turning these images
into catalogs enabling the primary science goals. In general these
catalogs can be thought of as falling into three categories: Level 1,
Level 2 and Level 3.

Level 1 data products are created during nightly processing. The
images in each visit are combined to reject cosmic rays, then
subtracted from a template image created from previously acquired
imaging (typically 6 months to a year earlier). The detections
measured in each difference image correspond to transients, variables,
moving objects, and artifacts. These outputs will be run through
machine learning algorithms to help reject artifacts. The resulting
detections, along with relevant information from existing catalogs
such as identification of known variable stars or the location of
nearby background galaxies, will be released within 60 seconds of the
end of each visit as the LSST Alert stream.

In addition, these difference image catalogs (after removing known
variable stars) will be used to feed the LSST moving object processing
system (MOPS). MOPS will link detections from different visits within
a night into tracklets, combine these with tracklets from
other nights into tracks, and finally fit the tracks with orbits; it will also extend
known orbits with new detections of these objects. These moving object
catalogs will updated and released on a daily basis.

The Alert stream and the moving object catalogs (the linked orbits and
their individual detections) make up the Level 1 data products. It is
worth noting that moving objects which are measurably trailed in any
individual visit will be clearly identifiable in the Alert stream as
such; very fast-moving objects thus have an additional discovery
avenue via Alerts.

Level 2 data products are created during yearly data processing and
include a more precise level of calibration in photometry and
astrometry. During the yearly data processing, all existing images
will be reprocessed using the most recent software release (including
reprocessing these images through MOPS, likely using slightly
improved templates for image differencing). These
data release catalogs will reach 10mmag absolute photometric accuracy
and 10mas absolute astrometric accuracy. The increased accuracy is
possible due to various algorithms that compute global solutions;
these are not run during nightly data processing.

Level 3 data products indicate data products resulting from
independently written (non-project) software, created using LSST data
access center compute resources. These data products will typically be
generated using extensions to the LSST DM software, and may or may be
publicly available depending on the user. Publicly available Level 3
data products which prove particularly useful could become fully
federated with LSST databases.

The LSST DM pipeline will be entirely open source and publicly
available. The various repositories that make up the DM software stack
can currently be found on github at \url{http://github.com/lsst};
more information about the stack and instructions for installing the
LSST software stack can be found at \url{http://dm.lsst.org}. Details
of the data products (images and catalogs) are defined in the LSST
Data Products Definitions Document (DPDD) \cite{LSST_DPDD}. All LSST
data products will be immediately publicly available to institutions
with data rights.

\section{LSST survey strategy}
\label{surveystrategy}

Many of the basic parameters of the LSST survey strategy -- telescope
size, field of view, approximate exposure time -- have been fixed. In
addition, given the survey length and constraints on the survey
footprint, the outer envelope of the survey characteristics can be
estimated: the survey likely has about 2.5 million visits to
distribute over about 30,000 square degrees for all survey fields,
with about 825 visits per field in the main survey footprint
($\approx18,000$ sq deg) to distribute between $ugrizy$ filters. Most
fields in the main survey footprint can be observed twice per night
(with an interval of about 30 minutes) every three to four days, on an
ongoing basis over their observing season, repeating for ten
years. This is the strawman LSST observing strategy at present.

However, the details of the observing cadence have not yet been
fixed. Instead of distributing visits fairly evenly in
time for all fields over all ten years, an interesting variant may be to
concentrate a subset of those visits for some fields into a shorter
period of time. For example, 10\% of the fields in the main survey
footprint could be observed 10\% more often in one year; this would
mean that in every other year these same fields would be observed
slightly more than 1\% less frequently. By shifting which 10\% of fields
were receiving more frequent observations, eventually the entire sky
could receive the same treatment. This has been described as a
`rolling cadence' option. Other options that may be interesting for
studying solar system objects might include taking more frequent
observations for fields near opposition and then reducing the number
of observations for fields away from opposition. The process of
optimizing the survey strategy in terms of cadence is just starting to
get underway.

LSST has several tools to help this process of survey strategy
optimization. The first is the LSST Operations Simulator (OpSim) \cite{opsim},
which combines a realistic weather history and a high-fidelity
telescope model with a scheduler driven by a set of proposals that
attempt to parametrize a basic observing strategy ({\it e.g.}, a
proposal for the main survey footprint that specifies the main survey footprint,
skybrightness and seeing limits, number of visits desired in each
filter, and the time window between pairs of visits in each night,
together with another proposal for the north ecliptic spur which
specifies a set of fields outside the main survey footprint targeted
for moving objects, a separate set of skybrightness and seeing limits,
etc.). The output of OpSim is a simulated pointing history, complete
with observing conditions and individual visit limiting magnitudes,
that demonstrate how LSST might survey the sky. A simple visualization
of an OpSim run is shown in Figure~\ref{footprint}; this also
illustrates the footprint for the survey in various proposals and
filters.

The second tool is a user-extensible python package called the LSST
Metrics Analysis Framework (MAF) \cite{maf}. MAF was created to help
analyze OpSim outputs. Using MAF, it is simple to write short pieces
of python code (`metrics') that can be plugged into the framework to
evaluate some aspect of OpSim. By collecting these metrics from a wide
representation of the astronomical community, and using these metrics
to evaluate various OpSim surveys created with a variety of scheduler
configurations (and eventually as optimization constraints during
scheduling), we hope to maximize science return from LSST across a
wide range of science goals. An example of using MAF to evaluate the
median time between revisits at each point on the sky is given in
Figure~\ref{time}.

OpSim and MAF are publicly available open-source software packages,
provided as part of the LSST Systems Engineering Simulations
effort. Instructions for installing them are available at
\url{https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/SIM/Catalogs+and+MAF}.
