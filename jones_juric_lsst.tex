\begin{abstract}
The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will be a ground-based,
optical, all-sky, rapid cadence survey project wiht tremendous
potential for discovering and characterizing asteroids.

With LSST's large 6.5m diameter primary mirror, a wide 9.6 square
degree field of view 3.2 Gigapixel camera, and rapid observational
cadence, LSST will discover more than 5 million asteroids over its ten
year survey lifetime. With a single visit limiting magnitude of 24.5
in $r$ band, LSST will be able to detect asteroids in the Main Belt
down to sub-kilometer sizes.  The current strawman for the LSST survey
strategy is to obtain two visits (each `visit' being a pair of
back-to-back 15s exposures) per field, separated by about 30 minutes,
covering the entire visible sky every 3-4 days throughout the
observing season, for ten years.

The catalogs generated by LSST will increase the known number of small
bodies in the Solar System by a factor of 10-100 times, among all
populations. The median number of observations for Main Belt asteroids
will be on the order of 200-300, with Near Earth Objects receiving a
median of 90 observations. These observations will be spread among
$ugrizy$ bandpasses, providing photometric colors and the possibility
of performing sparse lightcurve inversion to determine rotation
periods, spin axes, and shape information.

These catalogs will be created using automated detection software, the
LSST Moving Object Processing System (MOPS), that will take advantage
of the carefully characterized LSST optical system, cosmetically
clean camera, and recent improvements in difference imaging. [short
description of the DM section here].
